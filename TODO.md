# TODO: Create PHP Login Page for School Children Project

- [x] Create login.php with form, validation, and redirection to schoolchildren.html
- [x] Create logout.php for session destruction (optional)
- [x] Test the login functionality by running a PHP server
- [x] Update schoolchildren.html if needed for any integration (not required)

# Note:
The user reversed schoolchildren.html to its original state and requested to connect schoolchildren.js to the login page.
Please clarify what specific connection or integration is needed between schoolchildren.js and the login page.
